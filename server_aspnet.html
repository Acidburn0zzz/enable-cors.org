<p>
				If you don't have access to configure IIS, you can still add the header through ASP.NET by adding the following line to your source pages:
			</p>
			<pre class="code">Response.AppendHeader("Access-Control-Allow-Origin", "*");</pre>
			<p class="note">
				Note: this approach is compatible with IIS6, IIS7 Classic Mode, and IIS7 Integrated Mode.
