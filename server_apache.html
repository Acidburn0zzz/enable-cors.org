		<h1>CORS on Apache</h1>

<p>
				Apache can be configured to expose this header using <a href="http://httpd.apache.org/docs/2.0/mod/mod_headers.html">mod_headers</a>, this is enabled by default in Apache however you may want to ensure it's enabled by running the following command:
			</p>
			<pre class="code">a2enmod headers</pre>
			<p>
				To expose the header, you simply add the following line inside either the <code>&lt;Directory&gt;</code>, <code>&lt;Location&gt;</code>, <code>&lt;Files&gt;</code> or <code>&lt;VirtualHost&gt;</code> sections of your server config (usually located in a *.conf file, such as httpd.conf or apache.conf), or within a <code>.htaccess</code> file:
			</p>
			<pre class="code">Header set Access-Control-Allow-Origin "*"</pre>
			<p class="note">
				Note: you can also use <code>add</code> rather than <code>set</code>, but be aware that <code>add</code> can add the header multiple times, so it's likely safer to use set. Eventually, you may need to reload Apache to make sure your changes are applied.
